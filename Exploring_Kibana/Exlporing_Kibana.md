- List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

![](https://github.com/pdanny90/p_dan/blob/main/Exploring_Kibana/Images/2.6%20file%20downloaded.png)

	**gz: gzip, compressed archive using an algorithm**

	**css: programming language used for web pages**

	**zip: compressed archive**

	**deb: debian, linux compressed package**

	**rpm: like deb, but used for red hat enterprises**

3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.

 	**9,002**
 
- In your own words, is there anything that seems potentially strange about this activity?

	**There appears to be 2 suspicious visitors**

6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights.

- What do you think the user was doing?

	**One was downloading a apm file and the other was downloading a deb file**
	
- Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?

	**Probably not, the apm file is a performance application and the other a debian application.**

- Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity?

	**Unless you can see the actual file then there???s no real way of telling unless it's from a legitimate and trusted source.**
	
- Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidelines?

	**Nothing in particular stands out to me. Looks like normal use.**
