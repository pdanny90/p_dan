Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights.

What do you think the user was doing? One was downloading a apm file and the other was downloading a deb file
Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for? Probably not, the apm file is a performance application and the other a debian application.
Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity? Unless you can see the actual file then thereâ€™s no real way of telling unless it's from a legitimate and trusted source.
Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidelines? Nothing in particular stands out to me. Looks like normal use.
